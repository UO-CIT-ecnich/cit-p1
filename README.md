# Description
For Project 1, I successfully completed a series of tasks related to the command line interface (CLI), folder structure, ping utility, and JavaScript programming using Node.js and Visual Studio Code. It was an engaging project that allowed me to gain hands-on experience and learn valuable skills.

In Part 1, I ensured that I had completed Lab 1 and saved the "lab-01.zip" file in the appropriate folder. This step was crucial in setting up the project and ensuring I had the necessary foundation.

Part 2 focused on the command line and folder structure. Using various CLI commands, I created a folder structure based on the provided template. By capturing a screen image of the command execution and saving it as "p1-folders.png," I documented the process. Additionally, I verified that my folder structure matched the examples by using the appropriate command for my operating system and saved the output as "p1-tree.png." This step helped me become more proficient in using CLI commands and organizing files and folders.

Part 3 introduced the ping utility. I executed the ping command on different domains and captured screen images of the command execution. By using the break keyboard sequence, I learned how to exit a command line process. Saving the images as "p1-break.png" and "p1-ping.png" in my project folder allowed me to document my progress and experience with the ping utility.

Part 4 involved JavaScript programming using Node.js and Visual Studio Code. I created a JavaScript program named "p1-date.js" that outputted the current day of the week. By utilizing an array to store the days of the week and striving to solve the problem with a single line of code, I improved my coding skills and efficiency. I executed the program through both the command line and the Run and Debug option in Visual Studio Code, which gave me confidence in running and testing JavaScript programs.

In Part 5, I tackled another JavaScript program named "p1-random.js." This program generated a random string consisting of lowercase letters from the English alphabet. By implementing the provided "getRandomInteger" function and adhering to best practices, I was able to create a functional and concise solution. Including a documentation block at the top of the file ensured clarity and understanding.

Overall, Project 1 provided me with valuable experience in working with the command line interface, folder structures, the ping utility, and JavaScript programming using Node.js and Visual Studio Code. I learned the importance of proper documentation, code efficiency, and problem-solving skills. Completing the project independently gave me a sense of accomplishment and reinforced my ability to tackle similar tasks in the future.
